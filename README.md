### Notes:
- **Demo URL**: Once you host your app (e.g., using Expo or another service), replace the placeholder with the actual URL.
- **Assumptions & Design Decisions**: Modify these sections based on any specific choices you made during development.
- **Contributing**: You can expand this section if you want to encourage contributions from other developers.

### Hosting the Live Application
To provide a live URL for testing:
1. **Using Expo**:
   - If your app is built with Expo, you can run `expo publish` to generate a live link.
   - Follow Expo's documentation for hosting.
  
2. **Using Vercel/Netlify**:
   - If you converted your project to a web application using Expo or React Native Web, you can deploy it to Vercel or Netlify. 
   - Follow their respective documentation for deployment.

Once you have the live link, update the **Live Demo URL** section in your `README.md`.
